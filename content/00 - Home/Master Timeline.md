2. **Accreditation** - 18-24 months from application to approval
3. **Clinical Partnerships** - 3-6 months to negotiate and formalize
4. **Instructor Hiring** - Quality candidates take time to find
5. **Equipment Procurement** - Some items have 8-12 week lead times

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
