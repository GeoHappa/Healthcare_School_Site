## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CPT** | Current Procedural Terminology - standardized procedure codes |
| **Global Surgical Package** | All services normally included in a surgical procedure |
| **Modifier** | Two-digit code altering the meaning of a procedure code |
| **E/M** | Evaluation and Management - physician visit codes |
| **Add-on Code** | Procedure performed with a primary procedure, never standalone |
| **Unbundling** | Incorrectly billing separately for services included in a package |
| **Upcoding** | Billing for a more expensive service than performed |
| **Component Billing** | Separating technical and professional components |

---

## Common Coding Errors to Avoid

1. **Upcoding E/M** - Selecting level not supported by documentation
2. **Unbundling surgery** - Billing included services separately
3. **Missing modifiers** - Failing to add required modifiers
4. **Wrong modifier sequence** - Payment modifiers should be listed first
5. **Category III instead of I** - Using temporary codes when Category I exists
6. **Panel components** - Billing panel plus individual tests from that panel
7. **Global period violations** - Billing separately for included postop care
