## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Needlestick Injury
During a routine blood draw, the patient moves unexpectedly and the phlebotomist accidentally sticks their finger with the used needle.
- **Discussion:** What are the immediate steps? What documentation is required? What follow-up is needed?

### Case Study 2: Patient with Known Hepatitis B
A phlebotomist is assigned to draw blood from a patient known to have Hepatitis B.
- **Discussion:** What additional precautions, if any, are needed? Should the phlebotomist refuse? What PPE is appropriate?

### Case Study 3: Blood Spill
While transporting specimens, a tube breaks and blood spills on the floor of the hallway.
- **Discussion:** What are the cleanup procedures? Who should be notified? What documentation is required?

### Case Study 4: PPE Decision
A phlebotomist enters an isolation room to draw blood. The patient is on contact and droplet precautions for suspected influenza.
- **Discussion:** What PPE is required? What is the proper sequence for entry and exit?
