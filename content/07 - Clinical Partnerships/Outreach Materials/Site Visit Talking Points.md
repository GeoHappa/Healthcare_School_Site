## Opening (2-3 minutes)

### Introduction Script

> "Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I'm [NAME] from [SCHOOL NAME]. We're opening a healthcare training school here in Folsom, and I wanted to introduce ourselves and explore whether a clinical training partnership might benefit your practice."

### Build Rapport

- Comment positively on the facility
- Ask how long they've been at this location
- Ask about their patient population

---

## Discovery Questions (5-10 minutes)

### Understand Their Needs

**Staffing:**
> "How is your staffing situation? Are you finding it easy or challenging to hire qualified [MAs/phlebotomists]?"

**Experience with Students:**
> "Have you worked with student externs before? How was that experience?"

**Current Pain Points:**
> "What's your biggest challenge right now in terms of clinical staffing?"

**Decision Process:**
> "Who would be involved in a decision about hosting students?"

### Listen Actively

- Take notes
- Ask follow-up questions
- Show genuine interest

---

## Present the Opportunity (5-7 minutes)

### Key Points to Cover

**1. The Workforce Problem We Solve**

> "There's a real shortage of trained healthcare workers in our area. We're training local students who want to work locally—people who will stay in this community."

**2. What Makes Our Students Different**

> "Every student who comes to you will have:
> - Passed a background check and drug screen
> - Current immunizations and TB test
> - CPR certification
> - Completed all their classroom training
> - HIPAA training
>
> They arrive ready to learn in a real clinical setting."

**3. Benefits to Their Practice**

> "There are several ways this benefits you:
>
> First, it's a **hiring pipeline**. You get to evaluate students over several weeks instead of a 30-minute interview. If you like them, you have first access to hire them.
>
> Second, **extra hands at no cost**. Students aren't paid, and they're covered under our insurance.
>
> Third, your staff gets to **develop as mentors**, which many people find rewarding."

**4. Low Burden**

> "We handle all the paperwork—background checks, immunizations, liability insurance. You just provide the learning opportunity and some supervision."

**5. Flexibility**

> "We work around your schedule. You tell us what days and times work, and we'll make it happen."

## Handle Objections

### "We're too busy"

> "I completely understand—everyone is stretched thin. That's actually why students can help. Once oriented, they can assist with rooming patients, vitals, and routine tasks. We can start with just one student for a few hours a week and see how it goes."

### "We've had bad experiences with students"

> "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what happened? We want to make sure we address any concerns. Our students complete [X hours] of training before externship, and we maintain close contact during placement. If there's ever an issue, we address it immediately."

### "We don't have time to train"

> "Our students come to you already trained in the fundamentals. They just need experience applying those skills with real patients. Most of the learning happens by doing—shadowing your staff, then performing tasks under supervision."

### "What if it doesn't work out?"

> "You have complete authority. If a student isn't meeting expectations, you can request their removal at any time. We'll address the issue and find a different placement for them."

### "We need to check with corporate/administration"

> "Absolutely, I understand. Here's information you can share with them. Would it be helpful if I contacted them directly, or would you prefer to introduce us?"

### "We're not hiring right now"

> "That's fine—there's no obligation to hire. But when you are ready to hire, wouldn't it be nice to already know someone who's been trained and proven themselves in your practice?"

---

## Close the Conversation (3-5 minutes)

### Trial Close

> "Based on what we've discussed, do you think this could work for your practice?"

### If Positive

> "Great! Here's what happens next:
> 1. I'll send you a draft clinical affiliation agreement to review
> 2. Once signed, we'll coordinate student placement
> 3. I'll be your main contact throughout
>
> What questions do you have?"

### If Hesitant

> "I understand you might need some time to think about it. Can I follow up with you next week? What day works best?"

### If Negative

> "I appreciate your time and honesty. If your situation changes, please keep us in mind. May I check back in a few months?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

Be cautious if the site:
- Wants to use students as free labor without supervision
- Has high staff turnover or visible dysfunction
- Is unwilling to sign an affiliation agreement
- Asks students to perform procedures beyond their training
- Has compliance or safety concerns

**Your students deserve quality learning experiences. It's okay to decline a site.**
