## 10. Cancellation and Refund Policy

### Student's Right to Cancel

You have the right to cancel your enrollment agreement and obtain a refund of charges paid through attendance at the first class session, or the seventh day after enrollment, whichever is later.

Cancellation shall occur when the student gives written notice of cancellation at the address of the school shown at the top of the enrollment agreement. The written notice of cancellation, if given by mail, is effective when deposited in the mail, properly addressed with postage prepaid.

The written notice of cancellation need not take a particular form; however, it must clearly state that the student no longer wishes to be bound by the enrollment agreement.

### Cancellation Prior to or on the First Day of Class

If the school has collected money from a student for an enrollment agreement, and the student cancels prior to or on the first day of class, the school shall refund all money paid, less the registration fee not to exceed $250, within 45 days of cancellation.

### Withdrawal After Instruction Begins

If a student withdraws or is dismissed after instruction begins, the student is entitled to a pro-rata refund of tuition. The refund shall be the amount the student paid for instruction multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of hours of instruction that the student has not received but for which the student has paid, and the denominator of which is the total number of hours of instruction for which the student has paid.

### Refund Calculation

**Pro-Rata Refund Formula:**

Refund = (Total Hours Paid - Hours Attended) / Total Hours Paid × Tuition Paid

Example: Student paid $15,000 tuition for 800-hour program and withdrew after 200 hours:
- Refund = (800 - 200) / 800 × $15,000 = $11,250

### Non-Refundable Items

The following are non-refundable after instruction begins:
- Registration fee (maximum $250)
- Books and supplies (if issued and not returned in new condition)
- STRF fee

### Refund Timeline

Refunds will be paid within 45 days of:
- The date of cancellation, OR
- The date of determination of withdrawal (student's last date of attendance plus 14 days without contact)

### Determination of Withdrawal Date

The withdrawal date is:
- The date the student notifies the school of withdrawal, OR
- The last date of attendance if the student does not notify the school

If a student does not return from an approved leave of absence, the withdrawal date is the last date of attendance prior to the leave.
