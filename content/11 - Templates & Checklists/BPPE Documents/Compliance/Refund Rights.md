## After Classes Begin

### Pro-Rata Refund

If you withdraw after instruction begins, you are entitled to a **pro-rata refund** based on the percentage of the program completed.

### How It's Calculated

```
Refund = Total Paid - (Cost × Percentage Completed) - Non-Refundable Fees
```

**Example:**
- Total program cost: $10,000
- Amount paid: $5,000
- Hours completed: 200 of 800 (25%)
- Cost for hours attended: $10,000 × 25% = $2,500
- Refund: $5,000 - $2,500 = $2,500

### Important Notes

- Refund based on hours completed, not calendar time
- Includes scheduled hours whether attended or not
- Registration fee (up to $250) non-refundable
- STRF fee non-refundable

---

## 60% Completion Point

### After 60% of Program

If you have completed more than 60% of the program:
- No tuition refund is required
- You remain responsible for balance owed
- Other fees may still apply

### Why 60%?

California law sets 60% as the point where students have received substantial value from the program and refunds are no longer mandated.

## What's Refundable vs. Non-Refundable

| Registration fee (max $250) | Administrative costs |
| STRF fee | State-mandated, non-refundable |
| Books and supplies (if issued) | Used or cannot be returned |
| Equipment (if issued) | Used or cannot be returned |

### Books and Supplies

If you return books and supplies:
- Must be in original condition

---

## Withdrawal Date

### How Withdrawal Date is Determined

The date of withdrawal is the earlier of:

- Last date of attendance (if you stop attending without notice)
- Date school terminates your enrollment

### Why It Matters

The withdrawal date determines:
- How much of the program you've completed
- The amount of your refund
- When the 45-day refund clock starts

---

## If You Owe Money

### Balance After Refund Calculation

If you owe money after calculation:
- Balance is due immediately
- Payment plan may be available
- May be sent to collections if unpaid
- May affect transcript/credential release

### Example - Student Owes Balance

- Total program cost: $10,000
- Amount paid: $2,000
- Hours completed: 400 of 800 (50%)
- Cost for hours attended: $5,000
- Balance owed: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000
