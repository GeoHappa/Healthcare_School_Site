# Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)

---

## Overview

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) measures whether students are successfully progressing through their program. Students must meet SAP standards to remain enrolled.

---

## SAP Standards

### Three Components

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Qualitative** (GPA) | Minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA |
| **Quantitative** (Pace) | Complete 67% of attempted hours |
| **Maximum Time Frame** | Complete within 150% of program length |

---

## Qualitative Standard (GPA)

**Requirement:** Maintain cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher

### GPA Calculation
- Based on all graded courses
- Transfer credits not included in GPA
- See [[Grading Scale]] for grade points

---

## Quantitative Standard (Pace)

**Requirement:** Complete 67% of attempted clock hours

### Pace Calculation
```
Pace = (Hours Completed ÷ Hours Attempted) × 100
```

### What Counts as Attempted
- Completed courses
- Failed courses
- Withdrawn courses
- Repeated courses
- Transfer credits

### What Counts as Completed
- Passed courses (C or higher)
- Transfer credits

### Example
| Hours Attempted | Hours Completed | Pace |
|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| 300 | 200 | 67% ✓ |
| 300 | 180 | 60% ✗ |

---

## Maximum Time Frame

**Requirement:** Complete program within 150% of published length

| Program | Normal Length | Maximum Time |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Medical Assistant | 800 hours | 1,200 hours |
| Phlebotomy | 94 hours | 141 hours |
| Medical Coding | 460 hours | 690 hours |
| EKG Technician | 50 hours | 75 hours |

Students who cannot mathematically complete within 150% will be dismissed.
