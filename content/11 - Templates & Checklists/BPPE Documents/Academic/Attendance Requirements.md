## Why Attendance Matters

Regular attendance is critical because:

1. **Skill Development** - Healthcare skills require consistent practice
2. **Sequential Learning** - Each lesson builds on previous content
3. **Professional Habits** - Employers expect reliability
4. **Certification Prep** - Adequate seat time for exam readiness
5. **Clinical Eligibility** - Must complete theory before externship

## Attendance Tracking

### Daily Sign-In/Sign-Out
- Sign attendance log at start of class
- Sign out at end of class
- Instructor verifies attendance daily
- Electronic backup maintained

### Calculating Attendance Rate

```
Attendance Rate = (Hours Attended ÷ Hours Scheduled) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Scheduled: 100 hours
- Attended: 85 hours
- Rate: 85 ÷ 100 = 85%
