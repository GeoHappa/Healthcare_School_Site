## Grading of Completed Work

### How Final Grade is Calculated

When work is completed:
- Original work grades retained
- Completed work graded normally
- Combined for final grade
- Standard grading scale applied

### Example

- Student had 70% of course completed at B average (85%)
- Completed remaining 30% with C average (75%)
- Final grade: (0.70 × 85) + (0.30 × 75) = 82% (B)

---

## Multiple Incompletes

### Limits

- Maximum [2] Incompletes at one time
- Must resolve before taking additional courses (if applicable)
- Pattern of Incompletes may trigger SAP review

### Concurrent Incompletes

If multiple courses affected by same circumstance:
- Single request may cover multiple courses
- Same deadline for all
- Progress tracked for each

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does an Incomplete affect my GPA?**

A: No. Incompletes are for circumstances preventing completion, not for poor performance.

A: Request an extension in writing before the deadline. Extensions are not automatic.

**Q: Can I take new courses with an Incomplete?**
A: Depending on program structure and circumstances. Discuss with advisor.
