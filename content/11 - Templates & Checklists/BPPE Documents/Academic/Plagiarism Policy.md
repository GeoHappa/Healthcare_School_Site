## Forms of Plagiarism

### Direct Plagiarism
Copying text word-for-word without quotation marks and citation.

**Example:**
- Source: "Blood pressure should be measured with the patient seated comfortably."

- Correct: According to Smith (2023), "blood pressure should be measured with the patient seated comfortably" (p. 45).

### Paraphrasing Without Attribution
Rewording someone's ideas without giving credit.

**Example:**
- Source: "Phlebotomists must verify patient identity using two identifiers."
- Plagiarized: Those who draw blood need to confirm who the patient is using two forms of identification.
- Correct: Phlebotomists must verify patient identity using two identifiers (Smith, 2023).

### Mosaic Plagiarism
Piecing together phrases from various sources without citation.

Submitting your own previous work without permission, or submitting the same work for multiple assignments.

## How to Avoid Plagiarism

### Proper Citation

**When to Cite:**
- Direct quotes
- Paraphrased ideas
- Statistics and data
- Images and graphics
- Any information that isn't common knowledge

**How to Cite:**
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Include author and source information
- Follow required citation style (APA, etc.)
- Include reference list

### Good Practices

1. **Take careful notes** - Mark quoted material clearly
2. **Track your sources** - Record where information came from
3. **Paraphrase properly** - Use your own words AND cite
4. **When in doubt, cite** - Better to over-cite than plagiarize
5. **Start early** - Rushed work leads to shortcuts
6. **Ask for help** - Instructors can guide you

## Common Questions

**Q: Is it plagiarism if I didn't mean to do it?**
A: Unintentional plagiarism is still plagiarism, though intent may affect consequences.

**Q: Do I need to cite common knowledge?**
A: No. Facts widely known (e.g., "the heart pumps blood") don't need citation. When in doubt, cite.

**Q: Can I use my friend's notes?**
A: Using notes to study is fine. Copying their work as your own is plagiarism.

**Q: What if I cite but still use too much quoted text?**
A: Over-reliance on quotes, even when cited, may still be problematic. Use your own words.

**Q: Is paraphrasing without quotation marks okay if I cite?**
A: Yes, if truly paraphrased. Changing a few words isn't enough - it must be in your own words.
