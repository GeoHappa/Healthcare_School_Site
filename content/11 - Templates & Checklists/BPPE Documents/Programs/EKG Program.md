## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I work as an EKG tech with just this certificate?**
A: Yes, though some employers prefer combining with MA or other training.

**Q: Is EKG the same as ECG?**
A: Yes, EKG (from German Elektrokardiogramm) and ECG (Electrocardiogram) are the same test.

**Q: What's the difference between EKG tech and cardiac sonographer?**
A: EKG techs perform electrocardiograms; cardiac sonographers perform echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart) and require more extensive training.

**Q: Can I become a telemetry tech with this training?**
A: This provides foundation knowledge, but telemetry positions typically require additional training and hospital experience.
