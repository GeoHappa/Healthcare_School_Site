# Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) Disclosure

---

## What is STRF?

The State of California established the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate economic loss suffered by a student in an educational program at a qualifying institution, who is or was a California resident while enrolled, or was enrolled in a residency program, if the student enrolled in the institution, prepaid tuition, and suffered an economic loss.

> **Note:** The STRF assessment rate fluctuates based on fund balance. When the fund exceeds $25 million, the rate is reduced to $0. When it drops below $20 million, the rate increases (typically to $2.50 per $1,000). Check www.bppe.ca.gov for current rate.
