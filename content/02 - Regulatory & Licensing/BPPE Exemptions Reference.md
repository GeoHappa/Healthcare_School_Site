## Overview

CEC §94874 establishes 11 categories of institutions and programs that are exempt from BPPE approval requirements. Understanding these exemptions is essential for determining whether an institution requires BPPE approval.

**Important Notes:**
- Exempt status is determined by the institution's characteristics, not by self-declaration
- Institutions may voluntarily seek verification of exempt status (Form verification_exempt.pdf)
- Claiming exemption inappropriately can result in operating without approval (a serious violation)
- Some exemptions have significant limitations and conditions

### 7. Low-Cost Program Exemption
**Citation:** CEC §94874(f)

- Total institutional charges less than **$2,500**

**NOT Exempt:**
- Programs with total charges $2,500 or more
- Programs where any student receives financial aid
- Programs where any student takes out loans

**Practical Impact:** This exemption has limited applicability because:
- $2,500 threshold is very low for most vocational programs
- Financial aid disqualifies the exemption entirely

---

### 8. Law School Exemption
**Citation:** CEC §94874(g)

**Exempt:** Law schools meeting specific criteria.

**Categories of Exempt Law Schools:**
1. **ABA-accredited law schools** - Accredited by American Bar Association
2. **State Bar Committee accredited** - Accredited by Committee of Bar Examiners
3. **State Bar registered** - Registered unaccredited law schools under State Bar oversight

---

### 9. Workforce Development Nonprofit Exemption

**Requirements:**
- Organization must be 501(c)(3) nonprofit

**Citation:** CEC §94874(i)

**Exempt:** Institutions accredited by:
- **WSCUC** (WASC Senior College and University Commission)
- **ACCJC** (Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges)

**Practical Note:** These are the two regional accreditors specifically named for California. Institutions with this accreditation are exempt from BPPE oversight entirely.

**Why This Matters:**
- WSCUC accredits four-year colleges and universities
- ACCJC accredits community colleges
- Other regional accreditors (HLC, MSCHE, etc.) qualify for the abbreviated accredited pathway but NOT full exemption

---

### 11. Established Nonprofit Exemption
**Citation:** CEC §94874(j)

**Exempt:** Established nonprofit institutions meeting specific criteria.

**Requirements - ALL must be met:**
1. Operating continuously in California for **25+ years**
2. Maintaining 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status throughout
3. Student loan default rate below **10%** for most recent 3 years
4. NOT under investigation or enforcement action by BPPE

**This exemption is narrow:** Few institutions qualify due to the stringent requirements.

---

## Veterans Programs Exception

**Citation:** CEC §94874.2

**IMPORTANT:** Institutions otherwise claiming exemption under CEC §94874 **CANNOT** use that exemption for programs approved for veterans benefits.

If an institution offers programs where students use:
- GI Bill benefits
- Veterans Affairs educational benefits
- Military tuition assistance

Those programs require BPPE approval regardless of any other exemption the institution might claim.

---

## Verification of Exempt Status

**Citation:** CEC §94874.7; 5 CCR §71395

Institutions may voluntarily seek Bureau verification of exempt status.

**Form:** verification_exempt.pdf

**Process:**
1. Submit verification request form
2. Provide documentation supporting exemption claim
3. Bureau reviews and issues determination
4. Receive written verification (or denial)

**Benefits of Verification:**
- Formal Bureau confirmation of exempt status
- Documentation for business partners, lenders
- Protection against operating without approval claims

**Note:** Verification is voluntary - institutions are exempt by operation of law if they meet the criteria, regardless of whether they seek verification.

## Common Exemption Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "We're nonprofit so we're exempt" | Nonprofit status alone does NOT provide exemption |
| "We're religious so we're exempt" | Religious exemption has significant limitations for secular programs |
| "Our program costs less than $2,500" | Check if ANY students receive financial aid - disqualifies exemption |
| "We only do test prep" | If program includes career training component, not exempt |
| "We're accredited" | Most accreditation qualifies for abbreviated pathway, not full exemption |

## Healthcare Program Note

For healthcare training programs (Medical Assistant, Phlebotomy, Medical Coding, EKG):

**None of these exemptions typically apply because:**
- Programs are vocational/career-focused (not avocational)
- Programs typically cost more than $2,500
- Students often use financial aid
- Programs award credentials with career value

**Conclusion:** Healthcare vocational schools virtually always require BPPE approval.
