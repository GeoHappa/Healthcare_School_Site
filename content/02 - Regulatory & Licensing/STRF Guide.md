## Overview

The Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) is a consumer protection fund administered by BPPE that reimburses eligible students who suffer economic loss due to school closure, fraud, or other qualifying events. All qualifying institutions must comply with STRF requirements regardless of whether assessments are currently being collected.

**Key Points:**
- Fund administered by BPPE under CEC §94923
- Protects California resident students
- Current assessment rate: **$0.00 per $1,000** (effective April 1, 2024)
- Quarterly reporting required even when rate is $0
- Institutions must maintain complete student STRF records

## Current STRF Assessment Rate

| Effective Date | Rate | Status |
|----------------|------|--------|
| April 1, 2024 - Present | **$0.00** per $1,000 | Current |

## STRF Assessment Calculation

**When rate is greater than $0:**

| Total Institutional Charges | Assessment (at $2.50 rate) |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| $1,000 - $1,999 | $2.50 |
| $2,000 - $2,999 | $5.00 |
| $3,000 - $3,999 | $7.50 |
| $5,000 - $5,999 | $12.50 |
| $10,000 - $10,999 | $25.00 |
| $15,000 - $15,999 | $37.50 |

**Formula:** (Total Institutional Charges ÷ $1,000) × Rate = STRF Assessment
*Round institutional charges to nearest $1,000*

**Non-refundable:** STRF assessments are always non-refundable and must be disclosed as such.
