# Accreditation Pathway

## Overview

While BPPE approval allows you to operate, **programmatic accreditation** is critical for student success. Accreditation enables graduates to sit for national certification exams (like CMA) and may be required by employers.

## Why Accreditation Matters

| Benefit | Without Accreditation | With Accreditation |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| CMA (AAMA) Eligibility | No | Yes |
| Employer Recognition | Limited | Strong |
| Student Credibility | Lower | Higher |
| Title IV Financial Aid | No | Possible |
| Marketing Value | Weaker | Much stronger |

## Alternative Certification Paths (Without Accreditation)

### Year 1 Options (While Pursuing Accreditation)

| Certification | Requirements | Value |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| CCMA (NHA) | Any MA program completion | Good employer recognition |
| RMA (AMT) | ABHES graduate OR work experience | Strong alternative to CMA |

### Strategy for New Schools

**Year 1: Offer CCMA/RMA preparation**
- Graduates can certify immediately
- Builds track record for accreditation
- Market as "certification-ready"

**Year 2+: Add CMA preparation**
- Once ABHES/CAAHEP accredited
- Offer both options to students
- Premium positioning with CMA eligibility
