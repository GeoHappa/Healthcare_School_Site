# BPPE Enforcement & Compliance Guide

> **Reference:** Complete guide to BPPE compliance inspections, citations, fines, formal actions, and appeals. Understanding enforcement helps institutions maintain compliance and respond appropriately to regulatory actions.

---

## Overview

BPPE has broad enforcement authority to ensure institutions comply with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009. Enforcement activities range from routine compliance inspections to emergency closure authority for institutions causing student harm.

**Key Takeaway:** Proactive compliance is far less costly than reactive enforcement responses. Most citations stem from documentation gaps and procedural oversights that are preventable.
