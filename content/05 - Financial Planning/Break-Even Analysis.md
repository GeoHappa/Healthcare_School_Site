### Highest Margin Programs
1. **Medical Coding** (88%) - Computer-based, low supplies
2. **EKG** (83%) - Short, equipment reusable
3. **Phlebotomy** (82%) - Quick turnover
4. **Medical Assistant** (80%) - Longest, most supplies

## Key Break-Even Drivers

### To Speed Up Break-Even:
1. **Pre-sell enrollments** during BPPE approval period
2. **Owner teaches** to reduce payroll initially
3. **Start with 2 programs** (MA + Coding), expand after break-even
4. **Aggressive marketing** to fill first cohorts quickly
5. **Negotiate rent abatement** during build-out

### To Protect Break-Even:
1. **Maintain 80%+ class fill rates**
2. **Keep attrition below 15%**
3. **Control marketing spend** - target $500-$800 per enrolled student
4. **Avoid over-staffing** - hire based on enrollment growth
5. **Monitor cash flow weekly** in first 18 months

## Minimum Viable Enrollment

To cover core costs and remain operational:

| Phase | Monthly Costs | Students/Month | Annual Students |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Survival | $20,000 | 2.5 | 30 |
| Sustainable | $35,000 | 4.4 | 53 |
| Growth | $50,000 | 6.3 | 75 |

**Minimum viable:** 30-40 students per year just to keep lights on
**Sustainable:** 50-60 students per year for modest profitability
**Growth mode:** 75+ students per year for reinvestment and expansion

---

## Cash Reserve Recommendations

| Phase | Recommended Reserve | Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Pre-Launch | 6-8 months operating | Survive BPPE wait |
| Year 1 | 4-6 months operating | Handle slow ramp |
| Year 2+ | 3 months operating | Normal buffer |

**Recommended startup cash reserve: $150,000 - $200,000**
