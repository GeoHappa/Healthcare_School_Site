## Funding Sources

### Self-Funding

- Home equity
- Retirement accounts (with caution)

### Bank Loans

- Requires business plan, collateral

### Alternative Financing
- Equipment financing/leasing
- Line of credit
- Tuition pre-sales (early enrollment discounts)

### Grants (Limited)
- Workforce development grants (rare for for-profit)
- Economic development incentives (varies by location)

---

## Cash Flow Considerations

### Pre-Revenue Period
- BPPE approval: 6-12 months
- Facility setup: 2-3 months
- **Total pre-revenue:** 8-15 months

### Revenue Ramp-Up
- Month 1-3: First cohort (partial revenue)
- Month 4-6: Second cohort starts
- Month 7-12: Stabilizing enrollment

### Break-Even Estimate
- Monthly fixed costs: ~$25,000-$40,000
- Tuition per student (blended): ~$8,000
- Students needed monthly: 3-5 to break even
- **Break-even timeline:** 12-18 months

---

## Budget Scenarios

### Conservative (Low Budget: $183,000)
- Smaller facility (2,000 sq ft)
- Basic equipment, minimal build-out
- Owner as primary instructor initially
- Lean marketing

### Moderate (Target Budget: $265,000)
- Mid-size facility (2,800 sq ft)
- Quality equipment, professional space
- 1-2 hired instructors
- Robust marketing

### Aggressive (High Budget: $350,000)
- Larger facility (3,500 sq ft)
- Premium equipment, turnkey space
- Full staff from day one
- Heavy marketing investment

---

## Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Lease equipment** instead of buying (phlebotomy chairs, computers)
2. **Start with 2 programs** (MA + Coding), add phlebotomy after CDPH approval
3. **Owner teaches** initial cohorts to defer instructor salaries
4. **Negotiate rent** - ask for 3-6 months free rent during build-out
5. **Buy used equipment** where appropriate (desks, chairs)
6. **Partner with hospitals** for donated training equipment
7. **Pre-sell enrollments** at discount for cash flow
